1.One thing that is associated with all the design patterns is that
  encapsulate the code parts which vary a lot and make separate group of classes to later extend or alter
  without affecting other classes.

2.Program to an interface, not an implementation

3.Favor composition over inheritance

4.Strive for loose coupling between objects that interact

5. Classes should be open for extension, close for modification (Open-Closed Principle)
