- Fly and quack methods are not common for all types of ducks. So we cannot put them in parent class
- we cannot create separate interface for this methods as well;
- Solution: We can create a set of classes for such kind of unique methods using DPs;


We used to have lots of unnecessary methods in Duck super interface which we needed to implement in all
children, if we had one necessary method in one child, then we had to have it in all children classes
which was a lot of unnecessary code;
-Solution: Just create interfaces for the behaviours => in DuckProblemSolution package;
For example: We have one interface FlyBehavior and can have multiple implementation classes
